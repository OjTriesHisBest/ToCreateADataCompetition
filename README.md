# UCL Data and Insight Data Competition

## Introduction 

In the spirit of collaboration, improving skills, and having fun, the UCL Data and Insight Community of Practice are going to host monthly-ish data competitions.

You will have the opportunity to play with fun datasets, experiment with new data techniques and build a portfolio of projects. Other people will learn from your entries and vice versa

---

## How it will work

Each competition will last a month and have a different theme. 

We will provide some recommendations for datasets but you do not *have* to use them. Just stick within the theme! At the end of the month, we will offer everyone a chance to present some of the work they've done during the month to the Community of Practice! 

## The schedule and themes

* October 2021 - Films
* November 2021 - Money

## Registration 

Throughout the relevant month, there will be an MS form for you to fill in. You can join any time during the month and submit your project to the Data and Insight Teams page. 

The registration will close one week before the month ends.
